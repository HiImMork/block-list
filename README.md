# Mork's Block List ü§î
Mork's Block List is a list of websites that I (Mork) deemed unsafe for consumption. These "unsafe" websites are not limited to just malicious websites trying to steal your information or those trying to let you download apps that will destroy your devices but also include websites/services such as trackers, ad services, etc. This list may also contain websites that you may consider as "biased". Full disclosure I hate the CCP, I'm not Pro-US, heck I'm not even Pro-PH. I advocate for a safe and free cyberspace and oppose those who wants to disrupt it.

# How Does It Work? ‚öôÔ∏è
This repository contains different versions of the list. Mainly a list that uses host file and another that uses dynamic filtering. This repository also contains other versions of the list like the version that's 99.99% political-biased-free and only contains malicious website but has long been outdated. Anyway, I am trying to make all  versions updated as much as I can.
