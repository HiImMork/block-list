# Mork's Block List ü§î
Mork's Block List is an AdGuard Filter List that blocks malicious, gambling, pornographic, and other websites. The rules in these list are currated based on the websites I encounter and websites I collated from Phishtank.org. This list is not regularly updated but I am trying my best to keep it up to date during my free time. This project is for non-profit and free to use or modify by anyone.

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è*Disclaimer*: This list contain malicious websites that could harm you if you open them. For safety reasons, I do not recommend you opening these websites at all or without proper protection such as VPN, antivirus, virtual machine, etc.
### ‚ÄºÔ∏èSome websites may also contain  NSFW content or any content inappropirate for viewing for minors. The content of these websites are beyong my control and are here simply for blocking purposes.

# Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
You can use this list by adding it to your AdGuard filter list or uBlock Origin filter list or anything that can use AdGuard's Filter Syntax. This list is specifically designed to work with uBlock Origin; since uBlock uses AdGuard's filter it should work on AdGuard too but I can't guarantee that it will be bug free. Below are the instructions on how to add this list to your AdGuard or uBlock Origin browser extensions.
