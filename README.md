# Mork's Block List

  Mork's Block List is a list of websites that me (Mork) has deemed unsafe for some reason and websites that I have 0 trust or bad reputation. This list is formated in the ancient style of host files. It is specifically designed to be used on Adaway for Android. 


How does it works?
  As already mentioned, this list is formatted in host file format where the domain of a website is redirected to the localhost `(0.0.0.0)`. When a user opens a website included in this list, instead of seeing the website, they will be given a blank screen or a connection timeout error preventing the user from accessing said website.
