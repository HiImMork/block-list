# Mork's Block List 🤔
Mork's Block List is a list of websites that I (Mork) deemed unsafe for consumption. These "unsafe" websites are not limited to malicious websites trying to gain access to, destroy, or steal data from your device and will also include ad services for adblocking and malicious trackers for your privacy. 

### *Disclaimer*: this list may also contain websites that might necessarily malicious and might be included due to personal reasons. 

# How Does It Work? ⚙️
This repository contains different versions of the list for different purposes and support for different platforms. I am currently maintaining this repository and keep it as up to date as I can.
