# Mork's Block List

This repository contains files, mainly files that is used to block websites in host file format. I mostly include websites that I think poses potential harm to users online such as clone websites of popular services, questionable websites, websites with low ethical standards, and other websites that I generally don't like or trust.


Please don't expect frequent updates because I only add domains here based on my activity. Feel free to download the file of your choice and modify it as you wish.


If you have further questions, suggestions, or any opinions to improve this repo, feel free to contact me via discord:
